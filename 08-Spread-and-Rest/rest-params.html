  // ... also used as Rest operator
  // ... as spread takes an array or iterable and unpacks it nto multiple items.. 
  // ... as Rest is exact opposite where it takes multiple things and packs them in array.

  //two common places for ...rest 
  // 1- function
  // 2- destructuring

  //function ...rest example
  //here we could use arguments if we don't know exact number of args, but we want first arg to be rate and REST of other to be amounts.
  
  function convertCurrency(rate, ...amounts) {
    // console.log(rate, amounts);
    return amounts.map(amount => amount * rate);
  }

  const amounts = convertCurrency(1.54, 10, 20, 23, 54, 1, 39);
  console.log({amounts});

  // destructuring example
  //here ...rest will bundle up every thing after first two elements into an array, because we only want first two as own variables and rest of them are related items.

  const runner = ['Shomail', 123, 5.5, 1.4, 8.3, 9.9];
  const [runnerName, runnerId, ...runnerMiles] = runner;
  console.log({runnerName, runnerId, runnerMiles});
